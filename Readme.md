# Sourcery workshops

Learn to use Sourcery to avoid having to type repetitive, boring code and improve your productivity & ease maintenance !

## Requirements

* This classroom expects that you already **know how to write Swift 4+ code**.
* We'll use Xcode 9.4.

During the workshops, we'll learn how to install Sourcery, but you are **encouraged to download the following ZIP file in advance** to have them around in your Download folders and avoid any download latency during the workshop:

* Sourcery 0.13.1 ([downloadable here](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/releases/latest))

* [Sourcery dedicated documentation's website](https://cdn.rawgit.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/docs/index.html)
* [Stencil documentation](http://stencil.fuller.li/en/latest/builtins.html)

## Walkthrough & Step-Commits

The workshop will consist of multiple steps that we'll go through together

* **All the individual steps that we're gonna follow are listed [in this repo's wiki](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/SourceryWorkshops/wiki)**.
* Each step is represented by an individual commit in the `steps` branch of this repository.

💡 Be sure to **keep that wiki open to follow along if you get lost**.
