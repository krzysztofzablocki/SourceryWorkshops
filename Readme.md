# Sourcery workshops

Learn to use Sourcery to avoid having to type repetitive, boring code and improve your productivity & ease maintenance !

## Sourcery Pro
The best way to learn and write templates is to use [Sourcery Pro](https://merowing.info/sourcery-pro/) as it features powerful editor and also extends your Xcode with live templates, there is also no neccesary manual integration to get started unlike CLI setup.

## Requirements

* This classroom expects that you already **know how to write Swift 4+ code**.
* We'll use Xcode 9.4.

During the workshops, we'll learn how to install Sourcery, but you are **encouraged to download the following ZIP file in advance** to have them around in your Download folders and avoid any download latency during the workshop:

* Sourcery 0.13.1 ([downloadable here](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/releases/latest))

## Resources

During the workshop, we'll use the following websites

* [Sourcery dedicated documentation's website](https://cdn.rawgit.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/docs/index.html)
* [Stencil documentation](http://stencil.fuller.li/en/latest/builtins.html)

## Walkthrough & Step-Commits

The workshop will consist of multiple steps that we'll go through together

* **All the individual steps that we're gonna follow are listed [in this repo's wiki](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/SourceryWorkshops/wiki)**.
* Each step is represented by an individual commit in the `steps` branch of this repository.

ðŸ’¡ Be sure to **keep that wiki open to follow along if you get lost**.

ðŸ’¡ In case you get lost or left behind, don't hesitate to look at the ![Step x.y](https://img.shields.io/badge/Step-x.y-blue.svg) markers in the wiki walkthrough and jump directly to the corresponding commit to catch up with the rest of the class!
